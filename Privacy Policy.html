Guideline 5.1.1 - Legal - Privacy - Data Collection and Storage

We continue to find that the app does not meet all requirements for apps that offer highly regulated services or handle sensitive user data. Specifically: 

- The app must be published under a seller and company name that is associated with the organization or company providing the services. In this case, the app must be published under a seller name and company name that reflects the Alpine Medical Center name.

- The account that submits the app must be enrolled in the Apple Developer Program as an organization, and not as an individual.

The guideline 5.1.1(ix) requirements give users confidence that apps operating in highly regulated fields or that require sensitive user information are qualified to provide these services and will responsibly manage their data.

Next Steps

To resolve this issue, it would be appropriate to take the following steps: 

- The app must be published under a seller name and company name that reflects the Alpine Medical Center name. If you have developed this app on behalf of a client, you may resubmit the app through their account, if they have one. You may also request an update to the company name on your account by having the Account Holder contact Apple Developer Support to request an update to the company name.

- The app must be submitted through an Apple Developer Program account enrolled as an organization. You may either enroll in a new Apple Developer Program account as an organization, or request that your individual account be converted to an organization account by contacting Apple Developer Support.

Please note that you cannot resolve this issue with documentation showing permission to publish this app on behalf of the content owner or institution. 



Guideline 5.1.2 - Legal - Privacy - Data Use and Sharing

The app privacy information provided in App Store Connect indicates the app collects data in order to track the user, including Other Data Types and Email Address. However, the app does not use App Tracking Transparency to request the user's permission before tracking their activity.

Apps need to receive the userâ€™s permission through the AppTrackingTransparency framework before collecting data used to track them. This requirement protects the privacy of users.

Next Steps

Here are three ways to resolve this issue:

- If the app does not currently track, update the app privacy information in App Store Connect. You must have the Account Holder or Admin role to update app privacy information.

- If this app does not track on the platform associated with this submission, but tracks on other platforms, notify App Review by replying to the rejection in App Store Connect. 

- If the app tracks users on all supported platforms, the app must use App Tracking Transparency to request permission before collecting data used to track. When resubmitting, indicate in the Review Notes where the permission request is located.

- Tracking is linking data collected from the app with third-party data for advertising purposes, or sharing the collected data with a data broker. Learn more about tracking.
